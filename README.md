# Hands-Free-Virtual-Mouse-for-the-Disabled
🖱️ Hands-Free Virtual Mouse for the Disabled
A computer vision-based assistive system that enables individuals with physical disabilities to control the mouse cursor using head movements and perform click actions with eye blinks—no physical input devices required. Built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, this project provides a real-time, low-cost alternative to expensive eye-tracking systems using just a standard webcam.

🔧 Features:

Real-time face and eye tracking using MediaPipe

Cursor movement via head direction

Mouse clicks via eye blinks

No external hardware required—works with any standard webcam

Designed for users with motor impairments (e.g., ALS, paraplegia, limb amputations)

🚀 Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI
